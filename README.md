Final Project

Stock Market Simulator

Team Members:
Alejandro Pelayo 

1. Project Overview:
A simple yet effecient stock market simulator that allows you to buy and sell stocks using fake money to then show you average price, and how much youve made keeping real world track of the value of your portfolio

2. Usage guide lines:
When buying a stock, input its ticker, not name (AAPL, not Apple)
It will see if you have enough money left (you start with 100,000)
If you do, the stock will be added to your portfolio 

When selling stock input ticker and quantity you want to sell
It will see if you have enough to sell and if you do it will sell it
You can also buy negative stock to sell

You can view your portfolio at the bottom of the website it neatly shows you what stocks you have, their value, and gain/loss

3. Dependencies (ChatGPT helped me find ones that work best)
FastAPI
Jinja2
yFinance 
Python 3.13

4. Project Structure

In final project there is a templates folder with the html code and outside of it there is a main.py file with the python code

It was a lot harder than I thought it would be. Building it upo from being very basic to slowly incorporating new ideas (gain/loss, total portfolio value, etc) and a lot of it was through help with AI of reviewing code to help clean it up or remove unncecessary code. Im pretty happy with the final website I think it could very easily get some modifications to add more information as it is quite basic but it does get the job done. This will help me moving forward as I realize the scope of a project like this. I had the actual code done but I tried adding new things and in turn ended up breaking my code and I needed help with fixing it which is not something I thought about when first starting off. But overall it was enjoyable. 

Best,
Alejandro Pelayo
